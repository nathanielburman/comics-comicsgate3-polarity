Title: Music Divided People Politically. She was polarity between two points.

Harley Quinn listens to music off far away thinking of a basket case from earlier in the day. She still practices medicine in Gotham. She still empathizes with her patients. The pills they prescribe are fools-proof and fully back by regulations that Joker controls now, as some kind of joke.

Harley identified the Republicans from the Democrats a long time ago. She knew who Mother wanted.

In this Universe, music is polarized. Politics seeped into our reality. Sex was Republican, The sex symbol was Republican, I mean Elvis was Republican. Abraham Lincoln was Republican. Republicans follow: Frank Sinatra, Taylor Swift, Ariana Grande, Rihanna, Drake, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson, Ted Nuget, Kid Rock, Shakira, Kanye West, Joe Perry, Gene Simmons, Prince, Britany Spears, Sammy Hagar, Hank William Jr., Kelly Clarkson, LL Cool J.

Democrats: Madonna, Dixie Chicks, grimes, Eminem, Mariah Carey, Gwen Stefani, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Jay-Z, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Beyonc√©, Billie Eillish, The Weeknd, Garth Brooks, Justin Timberlake.

The politics is filling up the cup. Politics is in everything now. This is comics gate 3.0. This is everything political. This is a New Universe. 626 636 646 656 666 676 686 696

People don't even hear their words anymore. They just say things in the wind that are completely untrue or hideously evil, all the time. They don't hear themselves when they talk. They can hardly even listen to music.

Did you know that, many people do not hear their own voice inside their minds when they think? Many people hear no voice at all and yet they are able to think. This boggles some people minds, these two differences. The people who hear their own voice in their heads think it normal. But in psychology we call that a hallucination, an auditory hallucination, son. If you hear your own voice, technically we can prescribe drugs for that. If you at any time hear more than two voices in that h3ad of yours then you are insane. If you hear any voice over the one that sound like your voice, you are insane dear.

The Trojan Horse is the Earworm.

That's fascinating! The experience of hearing music in one's head, commonly referred to as having an "earworm" or experiencing "musical imagery," is quite common. It often occurs when a song gets stuck in your mind and plays repeatedly, even when you're not actively listening to it.

This phenomenon can be triggered by various factors, such as recent exposure to the song, emotional connections to the music, or even random associations that your mind creates. Sometimes, the music in your head can be enjoyable and provide a pleasant background soundtrack to your thoughts. Other times, it can be intrusive or distracting, especially if it persists for an extended period.

Research suggests that hearing music in your head is a normal cognitive process and is related to the way our brains store and retrieve musical memories. It can vary in intensity and vividness from person to person. Some individuals may even have the ability to recreate complex musical compositions in their minds with remarkable accuracy.

If you enjoy hearing music in your head, it can be a creative source of inspiration and a way to explore different melodies, harmonies, and rhythms. However, if you find it bothersome or disruptive, there are techniques you can try to help alleviate or redirect the musical imagery, such as engaging in other activities, listening to external music, or engaging in mental tasks that require concentration.

Ultimately, the experience of hearing music in your head is a unique and personal one. Embrace it as a part of your musical journey and use it to enhance your enjoyment and appreciation of the art form.
